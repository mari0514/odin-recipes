  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>8 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
    <li>6 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package Smithfield® Cubed Ham</li>

  <h3>How to make Ham, Egg, and Cheese Quesadillas</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk together eggs, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended.</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs, stirring frequently, until scrambled to desired consistency. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Spread 1 teaspoon butter over 1 tortilla and place butter-side down in the same skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese over entire tortilla. Add 1/2 cup scrambled egg and 1/3 cup ham to one half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Fold cheese side over egg-ham filling, then flip quesadilla. Cook until golden and toasted, about 2 more minutes. Cut into 2 or 3 pieces. Repeat this step to make 5 more quesadillas.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>To Bake a Large Batch in the Oven:</h3>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter the outside of each tortilla with 1 teaspoon butter. Cover 1/2 of each tortilla with cheese, scrambled egg, ham, and another layer of cheese, in that order. Fold each quesadilla in half and arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>
