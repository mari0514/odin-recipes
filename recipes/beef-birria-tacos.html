  <h2>Birria de Res Tacos (Beef Birria Tacos)</h2>
  <p>Authentic Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>

  <h2>Birria Tacos Ingredients</h2>
  <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated birria tacos recipe:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
    <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
    <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
    <li>Olive oil: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
    <li>Tomatoes: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Vinegar: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
    <li>Tortillas: Use store-bought or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17500/corn-tortillas/">homemade corn tortillas</a>.</li>
    <li>Onion and cilantro: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Make Birria Tacos</h3>
  <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make these tacos de birria:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
    <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
    <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
    <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.</li>
    <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.</li>
    <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Can You Make This Recipe In the Slow Cooker?</h3>
  <p>You can prepare these birria tacos in a slow cooker as well, but you will be sacrificing a little bit of flavor. Prepare the birria the same way, but place in a slow cooker instead of a Dutch oven and cook on High for 4 to 6 hours or on Low for 6 to 8 hours.</p>
